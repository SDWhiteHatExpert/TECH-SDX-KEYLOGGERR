# TECH-SDX-KEYLOGGERR
A keylogger is a covert surveillance tool that, when deployed, discreetly captures and records every keystroke made on a targeted device. This insidious software can operate in the background, evading detection while silently logging all keyboard inputs, including sensitive information such as usernames, passwords etc.
's important to clarify that creating and distributing keyloggers, even with a note on GitHub discouraging illegal use, is generally against the terms of service of most platforms and could lead to serious consequences. However, if you have legitimate reasons for creating a keylogger, such as for educational purposes or ethical hacking in controlled environments, it's crucial to communicate these intentions clearly and responsibly.

If you're creating a tool for ethical purposes, consider providing documentation that emphasizes its responsible use and educational value. For example:
